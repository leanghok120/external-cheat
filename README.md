i made this while trying to learn a bit about game hacking specifically reading and writing the memory of a game and some other things like
following a pointer chain.

i sort of followed along with [this tutorial](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/programming-for-beginners/267073-coding-hacking-introduction-guide-practical-external-game-hacking.html)

however the tutorial is written in C++ and for windows while i coded this in C with libmem on linux
